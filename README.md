# Shelia_Spanish
This repository is a place to learn Spanish. Here, I give fun Spanish tutorials with images and sounds that make Spanish more fun!
Shelia Spanish is directed at anyone who wants to learn Spanish, whether you're American, French, or Chinese! We support a bunch of languages.
We're currently in progress, but, contact me at bugsywugsy@myyahoo.com and I'll let you know when I'm finished with it!
For now, you can just sit back and wait. That's what I do every day! And, by the way, I am the older sister of Justin Dellace, the man who works at target and knows
a lot about Google and Yahoo. I love collabs! If you're ready to collab with me, go ahead!
